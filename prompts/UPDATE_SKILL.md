Review the `workleap-logging` skill you created in the `./agent-skills/workleap-logging` directory and make sure that all API definition and examples match the current documentation available in the `./docs` folder. Ignore any documentation related to updates. Do not make mistake.

* What are the core concepts of `wl-logging` (loggers, log levels)?
* How do you create a logger using the `wl-logging` API?
* How do you configure log levels and control log verbosity?
* How do you attach contextual information to logs?
* What is the recommended way to log errors and exceptions?
* How should application-level and feature-level loggers be structured?
* How does `wl-logging` integrate with observability or telemetry tooling when documented?
* What are common mistakes when using `wl-logging` in an application?
* How should logging usage be reviewed and validated in pull requests?
